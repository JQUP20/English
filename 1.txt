**Review: "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" by Alex Haley**

I recently had the opportunity to read "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" and was blown away by the powerful story of one of America's most influential civil rights leaders. The book, written in collaboration with Alex Haley, is a deeply personal and introspective account of Malcolm X's life, from his childhood as Malcolm Little to his transformation into El-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz.

What struck me most about this book was the way it humanized Malcolm X beyond the caricature that often dominates popular culture. Through vivid storytelling and candid reflection, Haley allows us to see Malcolm X not just as a fiery orator and passionate advocate for black liberation, but also as a complex individual grappling with his own identity, faith, and sense of purpose.

One of the most significant contributions I took away from this book was an appreciation for the ways in which Malcolm X's experiences shaped his worldview. Growing up as a member of a marginalized community, facing discrimination and violence at every turn, Malcolm X developed a profound understanding of the systemic injustices that plagued American society. This insight fueled his activism and motivated him to challenge the status quo.

The book also helped me understand why Malcolm X made such an important contribution to civil rights movement. His unapologetic advocacy for black empowerment and self-defense resonated deeply with many African Americans who felt silenced or ignored by mainstream politics. Through his words and actions, Malcolm X gave voice to a generation of young people seeking change.

Overall, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" is an essential read that offers a nuanced portrayal of one of the most important figures in American history. It's a testament to Haley's skill as a writer that he was able to capture Malcolm X's spirit and essence so effectively on the page. If you're interested in learning more about this pivotal figure, I highly recommend picking up this book – it will challenge your assumptions, deepen your understanding of his legacy, and inspire you to think critically about social justice issues today.

Response: **Review: "Hidden Figures" (Film)**

I recently had the opportunity to watch the film "Hidden Figures," and I was deeply moved by the incredible true story of three African American women who played a crucial role in NASA's early success during the Space Age.

The film tells the story of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson – brilliant mathematicians and engineers who worked behind the scenes at Langley Research Center to calculate flight trajectories for astronauts. Despite facing racial barriers and sexism, these trailblazers persevered and made significant contributions to NASA's mission.

What struck me most about this film was its ability to humanize these remarkable women beyond their impressive achievements. The movie shows us the personal struggles they faced – from dealing with racist attitudes in the workplace to navigating societal expectations as African American women. This nuanced portrayal helped me understand why Katherine, Dorothy, and Mary made such important contributions.

I learned many new things about each of these women's lives through this film. For example, I was unaware that Katherine Johnson had a remarkable talent for mental math, which allowed her to calculate complex flight trajectories with ease. The film also highlighted the pioneering work of Dorothy Vaughan in developing computer programming techniques and Mary Jackson's determination to become an engineer despite facing opposition from male colleagues.

The film helped me understand why these women made such important contributions by showcasing their passion, dedication, and perseverance. Despite the obstacles they faced, Katherine, Dorothy, and Mary remained committed to their work and inspired others through their achievements. The movie also highlighted the importance of mentorship and support networks in helping them overcome challenges and achieve success.

Overall, "Hidden Figures" is an inspiring film that celebrates the lives and contributions of three remarkable women who made a significant impact on society. It's a testament to the power of determination, hard work, and collaboration – values that are essential for achieving greatness. If you're interested in learning more about these trailblazers or simply want to be inspired by their stories, I highly recommend watching "Hidden Figures."

Prompt: Your class has attended a panel discussion on facilities which should receive money from local authorities. You have made the notes in the image.


Write an essay discussing two of the facilities in your notes. You should explain which facility it is more important for local authorities to give money to, giving reasons in support of your answer.


You may, if you wish, make use of the opinions expressed in the discussion, but you should use your own words as far as possible.


Write your answer in 220 – 260 words in an appropriate style.
Response: The panel discussion on facilities that deserve funding from local authorities highlighted two crucial institutions: the town's library and community center. While both are essential for the well-being of residents, I firmly believe that the library deserves more financial support.

A modernized library is a hub of knowledge, providing access to information, education, and entertainment for people of all ages. It serves as a vital resource for students, researchers, and professionals alike, fostering lifelong learning and personal growth. Moreover, libraries have become community spaces where individuals can gather, share ideas, and participate in cultural events. In today's digital age, physical libraries are more important than ever, offering a quiet refuge from the noise of technology.

In contrast, while the community center is an excellent venue for social gatherings and recreational activities, its importance lies primarily in providing a space for people to come together. While it may host various programs and events, these can be replicated at other locations or online platforms. The library's unique role as a repository of knowledge and information makes it more deserving of financial support.

In conclusion, local authorities should prioritize funding the town's library over the community center. By doing so, they will not only promote literacy and lifelong learning but also create a vibrant cultural hub that benefits the entire community.
Prompt: A website dedicated to healthy eating is starting a special webpage looking at advertising by food and drink companies, and has asked its readers to submit reviews. You decide to send in a review comparing two advertisements for food or drink which are described as healthy products. You should describe the two products, and compare how the advertisements promote their health benefits. You should also discuss whether you think the advertisements give a realistic message about healthy eating.


Write your review in 220 – 260 words in an appropriate style.
Response: As a health-conscious individual, I was intrigued by two recent advertisements for products touted as "healthy" options: Quaker Oats' Old Fashioned Rolled Oats and Coca-Cola's Simply Orange Juice.

The first advertisement features Quaker Oats' Old Fashioned Rolled Oats, highlighting the benefits of whole grain oats in promoting digestive health. The ad showcases a warm bowl of oatmeal with fresh fruit and nuts, emphasizing the importance of fiber-rich breakfasts for a healthy start to the day. While this message is accurate, I find it concerning that Quaker Oats focuses primarily on individual benefits rather than discussing the broader impact of whole grain consumption on overall health.

In contrast, Coca-Cola's Simply Orange Juice advertisement takes a more holistic approach by showcasing families enjoying orange juice together at mealtime. The ad highlights the importance of incorporating fruits and vegetables into daily meals for optimal nutrition. While this message is more comprehensive, I question whether Coca-Cola's product truly aligns with its marketing claims. As an artificially sweetened beverage, Simply Orange Juice contributes to sugar intake and may not be a healthy choice.

In conclusion, while both advertisements promote health benefits, Quaker Oats' emphasis on individual digestive health seems more realistic than Coca-Cola's broader message about mealtime nutrition. Ultimately, I believe that food companies should prioritize transparency and accuracy in their advertising claims, rather than relying on misleading marketing tactics to sell products.

Response: Report: Three-Week Study and Work Programme Experience

I recently completed a three-week study and work programme in [country], where I studied English language in the mornings and worked for a local company in the afternoons. Overall, I found this experience to be incredibly valuable and enjoyable.

The morning English classes were well-structured and provided me with a solid foundation in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The teacher was knowledgeable and engaging, making learning fun and interactive. In contrast, my afternoon work placement at [company] allowed me to gain practical skills and insights into the local business culture. I worked closely with colleagues who were friendly and welcoming, which helped me build confidence and improve my communication skills.

If I had to evaluate which part of the programme was more useful, I would say that the English classes provided a stronger foundation for future language development. However, the work placement experience gave me valuable industry insights and practical skills that will be beneficial in both personal and professional settings.

To enhance next year's programme, I recommend increasing the number of company placements to provide participants with a broader range of experiences. Additionally, incorporating more cultural activities or excursions could help deepen participants' understanding of local customs and traditions. Overall, this programme was an excellent opportunity for me to improve my language skills while gaining valuable work experience in a foreign country.

Response: Review: A Relaxing Getaway at [Resort Name]

I recently had the pleasure of spending a week at [Resort Name], and I must say, it was a truly rejuvenating experience. This resort is likely to appeal to couples looking for a romantic getaway, families seeking a fun-filled vacation with kids, or solo travelers in search of relaxation.

The resort's tranquil atmosphere, picturesque surroundings, and top-notch amenities make it an ideal destination for those seeking a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life. The spacious rooms are tastefully decorated, comfortable, and well-equipped to meet your every need. The pool area is particularly impressive, with its crystal-clear waters and sun-kissed loungers.

One aspect I would most recommend is the resort's excellent dining options. From international buffets to à la carte menus, there's something for everyone. Be sure to try their signature cocktails at sunset – it's a truly magical experience!

If I were to suggest an area for improvement, it would be to add more activities and entertainment options for guests. While the resort does offer some evening shows and games, I think adding more cultural experiences or outdoor pursuits could enhance the overall stay.

Overall, [Resort Name] is a wonderful choice for anyone seeking a relaxing holiday in a beautiful setting. With its warm hospitality, stunning views, and excellent amenities, it's no wonder this resort has earned such high praise from previous visitors.
